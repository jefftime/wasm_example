ANSI C WEBASSEMBLY DEMO

  This repository demonstrates compiling ANSI C to WebAssembly only using clang
  and wasm-ld. It also doesn't require using a web server to provide the .wasm
  file. It can be run in a browser straight from the index.html file

PREREQUISITES

  This project requires you to have the following command line tools:

    * clang
    * wasm-ld
    * truncate
    * echo
    * base64

USAGE

  You can run this demo by running:

    $ make

  Then simply open the index.html in an ECMAScript 6-conforming browser. You
  should see output in the console from the WebAssembly function call.
